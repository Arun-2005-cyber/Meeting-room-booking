**📌 Meeting Room Booking Service – Backend API**

  A fully functional backend service for managing rooms, bookings, cancellation, idempotency, concurrency-safe operations, and utilization reports.

  This project is designed as a clean, testable backend demonstrating real-world booking system requirements.

**🚀 Tech Stack Backend**

  Node.js

  Express.js

  PostgreSQL

  pg (PostgreSQL client)

  Luxon (date-time handling)

  Joi (validation)

  Nodemon

  dotenv

  Architecture

  Controllers → Handle request/response

  Services → Business logic

  Repositories (DB) → Database queries

  Middleware → Error handling, idempotency

  Validators → Joi schemas

  Routes → API endpoints

**🛠 Features Implemented**
  *✅ Room Management*

  Create room

  List rooms with filters (minCapacity, amenities)

  Unique room name validation

  *✅ Booking Management*

  Create bookings with:

  No overlap rule

  Duration limit (15 minutes – 4 hours)

  Allowed only Mon–Fri, 08:00–20:00

  List bookings with pagination and time filters

  Cancel bookings with rules

  Cancelled bookings do NOT block new bookings

  *✅ Idempotency-Key Support*

  Prevents duplicate bookings

  Concurrent-safe using DB-level locking

  Key preserved per-organizer

  *✅ Reports*

  Room utilization reports

  Calculates booked hours vs business hours

  Handles partial overlaps

  *✅ Error Handling*

  Consistent error format:

  {
    "error": "ValidationError",
    "message": "startTime must be before endTime"
  }

**⚙️ Environment Variables**

  Create a file named .env:

  PORT=3000
  DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/meeting_booking

**🧪 Endpoints Summary**

*Rooms*
  Method	Endpoint	Description
  POST	/rooms	Create room
  GET	/rooms	List rooms

*Bookings*
  Method	Endpoint	Description
  POST	/bookings	Create booking (with Idempotency-Key)
  GET	/bookings	List bookings
  POST	/bookings/:id/cancel	Cancel a booking

**▶️ Steps to Run the Project Locally**

*1. Clone the project*
  git clone <your-repo-url>
  cd meeting-booking

*2. Install dependencies*
  npm install

*3. Configure .env file*
  Make sure PostgreSQL is running.

*4. Run database migrations (if you created migration files)*
  npm run migrate

(If no migration script, create tables manually.)

*5. Start the server*
  nodemon src/server.js

*6. Server will start at*
  http://localhost:3000

**🧪 Running Tests**

  If you have test scripts:
  npm test

**🚀 Future Enhancements**

  JWT Authentication for organizers

  Admin panel API for room management

  Recurring bookings

  Automatic conflict resolution suggestions

  UI Dashboard for viewing bookings

  Email notifications (booking confirmation, cancellation reminder)

  Calendar Sync (Google/Outlook)

  WebSockets for live booking updates

  Role-based access (Admin, Manager, User)

**📘 DESIGN.md Overview**

  A separate DESIGN.md file can include:

  Data model explanation

  rooms

  bookings

  idempotency_keys

  How overlapping is prevented

  SQL query checking intersecting time ranges

  Verified inside DB transaction

  Idempotency implementation

  Table with unique constraint (key, organizer_email)

  Returns same booking on repeated requests

  Concurrency

  DB transaction ensures atomic write

  Prevents duplicates under load

  Utilization calculation
  utilizationPercent = totalBookedHours / totalBusinessHours
